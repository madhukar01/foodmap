We got 2 high seats with a very small round table which was way too congested given the smallness of the table. At a time it can hardly accommodate more than 3 small plates. Given that there was no other place to occupy we took it. We ordered spicy cottage cheese and thai noodles. While the quantity of former is decent and tasted good, the latter tasted horrible although the portion wass huge. We couldn't complete the noodles and we have left more than 3/4th portion.We had 4 beers(heinken) which costed 1800 which is too high for the kind of ambience and seating they provided. The service was super quick, with sever getting us main course first and starter later!!.We asked him to get starter first.Now this is what is not expected of a restaurant which claims to be a Premier one. It was a techno music night which really didn't help the mood. We are not into techno may be because of that but it was a great spoiler for a nice evening. After sometime we asked for a different seating closer to the edge with a great city view. Well the view is astounding. One has to visit this for the views only.

I have known the place to be expensive and hence decided to go on a Monday to avail the all day Happy Hours. I also wanted to try the highly rated seasonal, the Mango Saison. The beer was good. However it resembled more of a Pale Ale than a Saison with high hoppiness and hence was not quite to my palate. I was not in IPA mood \ud83d\ude02. However after sipping this one you will burp Alphonso mangoes which does a bit in balancing out the bitter after taste . I chose a Hefeweizen for the next round and it was refreshing. The last round was a half pint of Stout which I did not find it to be very special. So the Dry Stout of Toit with the creamy head continues to be my favorite. My wife chose a Mango flavored Mojito. The drink was just okayish inspite of being priced at 600. Coming to the food we started with the Prawn roll and Pork Siders. The Prawn roll was outstanding. It reminded me of the Fried Prawns you get in Malabar, so homely \ud83e\udd17. The meat in the Pork siders has almost zero fat which was a delight. For mains we picked Nalli ka Salan which was juicy and delightful. Full marks to the food. The service was prompt with the IPads and the waiter was also cordial. Coming to the turn offs, I did not like the dining table for the couple. It was too long for the people on opposite sides to have a proper conversation. The 2 seater tables are parallel to the 6 seater or 8 seater tables which are properly laid out. Perhaps this is a clear indication that they are looking to receive corporate teams than the regular couples. Well... Whitefield has options for the beer enthusiasts cum food lovers.

We started with the beer sampler tray which gave 7 varieties of beer that the place had to offer and they were all nice. In food we ordered the Veg Nachos twice and it was in sufficient quantity. The fries (potato something) came with a green chutney which was a nice combo.

I must say I wasn't disappointed after my first visit. The place is beautiful and the ambience is simply amazing, you literally feel you are inside a sophisticated garden. The food is good and so are the drinks and the brewed beer. The stewards are extremely polite and they serve you continously with a beautiful smile on their faces. The place is quiet expensive and not at all pocket friendly. Overall a great place and a must visit in Bangalore.", "Beautiful place and awesome food.", "This is located above haute fitness and it\u2019s a very big restaurant. I didn\u2019t like the theme over there , it had so many reflectors and it was a little hot over there. It says it\u2019s a garden themed restaurant but didn\u2019t feel that way. The tres leches is a must try and it\u2019s so good. Onion and molten , smoked chicken sandwiches were fine but this restaurant is a costly one."], "rating": "4.2/5"}}
