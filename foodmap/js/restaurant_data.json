A bit congested to move around in buffet area and very noisy. Hospitality was good. Starters Veg variety was good. Paani Puri counter was innovative. Rest of food was up to the mark. The important point is it\u2019s all good value for money here, found it not too harsh in the wallet for the quantity of food and ambience, good place to take extended family and friends for an occasion.", "Went there yesterday with my office colleagues. Restaurant is little crowded and it took around 10 mins to get a seat despite pre booking.", "Flechazo is located on Doddanakkundi on the outer ring road near to Marathahalli. It also has got ample parking space so you dont have to worry about the parking. In case, if you are visiting on the weekend please make sure you book the table in advance as the place will be crowded.", "The experience for buffet dinner was great. The stuff were very enthusiastic to help and guided the right choices of food. The interesting things were make your own pizza and the starter conveyor. The location is a bit odd but still can be figured out easily from main road.", "I choose this place by seeing the food menu and the photos of the ambiance on Zomato. But when I actually went there for lunch with my team I was amazed and surprised at the same time that how they are serving such good quality food in such low prices. This place is good for team lunches and the one who loves buffet.", "Spreadwise this place has good variety, viz. soups, chaats, dimsums, shawarmas, sushis, kababs, pizzas, pastas and what not to start with! We went on a Monday for a nonveg buffet @566/- at 2 p.m. and the place was full packed with people even waiting outside! Our table attendant Ashish gave a commendable service with some customised dishes served on table even within the rush around. They served welcome orange mocktail and after lunch complimentary Mojito too. The chicken biryani in main course was the best I had in any buffet so far. The mutton was a bit hard though. Only downside was some of the food items like dimsums, jalebis were cold or replenished quite late and people had to wait for quite some time even for getting dessert plates or spoons. Also we felt the waiters in a bit hurry naturally because of the rush but if this can be improved then nothing better.", "One of the finest buffet place in Bangalore.", "I went to this place for a team lunch. Tried their buffet. Good variety of food both in veg and non veg. The starters were good. But some were not hot. The desserts were really good. They have live pasta and nitrogen ice cream counter. Ice cream was really good. Service was good. Food was ok."]}, "https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/byg-brewski-brewing-company-hennur-bangalore": {"name": "Byg Brewski Brewing Company", "rating": "NEW", "location": [13.070964, 77.651618], "reviews": ["Its much more bigger than its NAME!!", "Wow .. A humongous place to stroll around with your drinks, do a little catch up or just sit by the bar and overlook the beauty .. The reservation deck did create a little problem as we entered.. We had a friend inside who had a table but the lady asked our friend to come out n get us. Only then would she let us in. The service as of now is not upto the mark. The waiters are ignorant of what drink is getting served. Some of the areas are not yet operational and their brewed beers wouldn\u2019t start till September. With a little here and there initial technicalities , this place is booming. The area and the ambience is amazing. Food is good and reasonably priced.. Very excited for them to be in the neighbourhood..", "A wonderful place, a pleasant change to the landscape of Hennur , wonderful food , amazing cocktails, Brewery is not running yet,can forget sangam \ud83d\ude02,", "It's BYG, literally.

Its a nice place. The food is good. Their brewed beer is also nice. The dance floor is in the 4th floor for which there is a cover charge of Rs.1000 per couple which is redeemable inside. The dance floor is big but it was very very crowded, maybe because of a saturday. They play Bollywood songs on Saturday night. Overall a good experience.", "I visited this place on my very first trip to Bangalore. And what an amazing experience it was. It was a bollywood night and the dj was superb. One of the best dance floors I have been to. The next time we went in search of some north indian food.

We had been here once before and had a decent time but this time it came as our nightmare. Everything was just so bad. I would give them minus stars for their service if there was an option for that. Pricey for no damn reason, ill mannered staff, bad DJ and on top of that bad food. I wouldn't go there again and wouldn't suggest anyone as well."]}}
